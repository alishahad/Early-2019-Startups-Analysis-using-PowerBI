# Early-2019-Startups-Analysis-using-PowerBI
What are the key "Backbones" for every startup? is it depend on Idea? Funding? Timing? or category? we can find out in this short Analysis.
As we see day by day new startups are emerging in different categories and Investors are investing in these startups. 
But what makes these startups succeed or fail? And why I am showing Analysis of 2019 first Quarter it's 2020, We can say it's better to 
learn from the past. So back to the question why some startups survive and some fails but what makes the investors invest in them even 
some startups are not successful even till many rounds, and why the location matters why the category matters?, Even in same categories 
every day new ideas are emerging in the market is it making the market too crowded or competitive.

Every time new startups emerge it brings a hype in the market, but why they give-up I will leave that up to you, 
but according to my research and analysis, we bring great ideas but with no sales executions. Sales are the key backbone of every 
company and every investor sees what they will get is this idea has potential, how long they will survive even if there are the same 
category of a successful company running why still we invest? To look for some of these questions i tried to analyze and visualize this 
below image in PowerBI, i couldn't share the live dashboard, I will try to give a short brief.

From Dashboard in PowerBi
According to this Analysis in the First Quarter of 2019 Enterprise startups were successful to raise the funding mostly. 
How much they have raised and in which regions and which time period?

if we Analyse the Enterprise category we can see the regions globally and it has raised $9.63 Billion, But if we break this down to 
monthly Analysis from the donut chart we can see that in January they were able to raise $6.2 Billion, which make 12.8% of the total 
amount. When we move to February we see a huge drop from January which is $1.44 Billion, which is 2.97% so from 12.8% to 2.97%, but 
when we move to March it turns to raise slowly which is $1.99 Billion, that makes it 4.11%. This shows that at the start of the year 
the Funding is high according to Techcrunch "the funding is seasonal". The second analysis is geographical which indicates that 
Enterprise startups were mostly founded in North America and in Europe. Well, there is a lot of categories as you see by yourself like 
Fintech was the second most favorite but this was a short analysis. Now the question is in which round the Startups make more funding 
and catch the eyes of investors.

If we are talking about the rounds because every startup is going through different rounds that attract the investors so if we look at 
above chart we can see that in round B most of the startups successfully raised $6.78 Billion.

This is a short analysis done in PowerBI and in R, from above charts we can analyze that what matters is it "Funding"? in my recent 
discussion with different CEO's and Founder they said they don't want to go for funding and investors they want to acquire the model 
of commission-based sales but since 3 years I had run through different Founders and when I asked them what about your model of 
commission-based they said they had to change it why? it has not such motivation. We build such idealistic, software, Apps tools, 
that the society the world needs it but what goes wrong the answer is "Sales". I am working with Growmatica.com and in my personal 
experience I had an opportunity to work with so many startups and in front of me I saw how their sales went to above the target, why 
because of Sales experienced people and understanding the mentality of each market with deep analysis. According to this short analysis
which I found common in every successful startup is teamwork.

your comments and suggestion will be an honor for me.
